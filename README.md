# Earthquake Prediction Model

## Overview

This repository contains a simple earthquake prediction model implemented in Python. The model is based on synthetic data and is designed for educational purposes. Building a real-world earthquake prediction model requires a large dataset, specialized knowledge, and collaboration with domain experts.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Praveena1829/earthquake-prediction-model.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd earthquake-prediction-model
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:

        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - On macOS/Linux:

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

5. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the earthquake prediction model script:

    ```bash
    python earthquake_prediction_model.py
    ```

2. The script will generate synthetic earthquake data, train a RandomForestClassifier, and evaluate the model's performance on a test set.

## Data

The synthetic earthquake data includes the following features:

- Magnitude
- Depth
- Latitude
- Longitude
- Time

The label indicates whether an earthquake occurred (1) or not (0).

## Model Evaluation

The script will output the accuracy and a classification report for the model's performance on the test set.

## Disclaimer

This model is a basic example for educational purposes and should not be used for real-world applications. Creating an accurate earthquake prediction model requires domain expertise and collaboration with seismology experts.

Feel free to explore and modify the code for educational purposes or use it as a starting point for more advanced models.

## Overview

This repository contains a simple earthquake prediction model implemented in Python. The model is based on synthetic data and is designed for educational purposes. Building a real-world earthquake prediction model requires a large dataset, specialized knowledge, and collaboration with domain experts.

## Data Source

The synthetic earthquake data used in this model is generated for educational purposes. In a real-world scenario, earthquake prediction models rely on data from seismic monitoring agencies such as the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Access to real seismic data would require collaboration with these organizations.
